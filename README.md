# Install-git-lfs

I was looking for a way to install entirely from the command line (server/VM setup), and was able to do so by following the instructions from the documentation, copied below for reference.

* sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
* sudo curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash*
* sudo apt-get install git-lfs
* git lfs install
